## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a well-organized and easily accessible archive of all reports generated by the NextGen Innovator club. This includes weekly meetins, project updates, and other reports that may be generated by the club. By maintaining a central repository, we can ensure that all reports are easily accessible to all members and all party concerned.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
Reports/
│Date/
│   |Attachments/
│   │   │Attachment1
│   │   │Attachment2
│   │README.md
README.md
```

- **Date**: Each report is stored in a folder named with the date of the report. This ensures that reports are easily searchable and organized chronologically.
- **Attachments**: Any attachments or supporting documents for the report are stored in the `Attachments` folder.
- **README.md**: The main report file is stored in the root of the date folder.
